* Lineal
Basic linear algebra being implemented in Clojure and fronted with a web app. This is not intended as a library (there are many better libraries if you want to actually perform linear algebra computqations), but is my way of better understanding linear algebra. 

** Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

** Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run
