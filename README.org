* Lineal
Basic linear algebra being implemented in Clojure and fronted with a web app. This is not intended as a library (there are many better libraries if you want to actually perform linear algebra computqations), but is my way of better understanding linear algebra. 

** Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

** Disclaimer, Alternatives
Lineal is essentially just my notes as I master linear algebra; it is NOT intended as a workhouse library. If you want industrial or research-strength Clojure tools for linear algebra, try other libraries:

- [[https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal][Neanderthal]] (highly optimized use of GPUs for linear algebra calculations)
- [[https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix][core.matrix]] Relatively lightweight yet sound matrix calculations, to be included in Clojure core.

** Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run
